 * (this is the part you have to supply, together with the extra parameters
 * needed by the program), for instance, add some noise, and then save the
 * results. The output images can be the same input ones, or new ones (in case
 * of an image, the user must supply the output name, and for selection files,
 * he must supply an output extension). If an error occurs, the routine shows
 * the error message and exits 1, ie, the program is aborted.
