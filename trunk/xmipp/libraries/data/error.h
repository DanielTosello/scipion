/** @defgroup ErrorHandling Error handling
 *  @ingroup DataLibrary
 *
 * The error handling is performed in two different ways depending on the
 * configuration selected for Xmipp in the file xmippConfiguration: a simple
 * error management and a second method based on C++ exceptions.
 *
 * The first method aborts the program with an error code (different for each
 * error) while the second throws an exception which might be caught by an
 * external routine or program.
 *
 * The prototype definitions in both cases are the same as they are based on
 * some macros which change with the configuration. Here goes a programming
 * example considering both implementations.
 *
 * @code
 * // Class definition
 * class ReconstructingVolume :
 * {
 * ...
 * void write(const FileName& fn) const;
 * ...
 * };
 *
 * // Class implementation
 * void ReconstructingVolume::write(const FileName& fn) const
 * {
 * ...
 * if (...)
 *     REPORT_ERROR(6001, "Volume too small to be stored");
 * ...
 * }
 *
 * // Use of this class in an external program
 * using std::cout;
 * using std::endl;
 * ...
 * #ifndef _NO_EXCEPTION
 * try
 * {
 *     vol_blobs.write(fn_blobs);
 * }
 * catch (Xmipp_error XE)
 * {
 *     std::cout << XE;
 *     std::cout << "The reconstructed volume is too small to be saved in blobs";
 *     std::cout << "So, there is no blob version of it at this iteration";
 *     std::cout << "I go on processing" << std::endl;
 * }
 * #else
 * vol_blobs.write(fn_blobs);
 * #endif
 *  ...
 * @endcode
 *
 * You see that the routine implementation is the same in both cases but the
 * external program varies from one to the other as in the exception case we can
 * catch the exception and go on processing, while in the exit mode, the program
 * always is aborted. If you don't put the routine in a try-catch structure and
 * an exception is thrown then a core is generated and the program is
 * automatically aborted.
