# Ref. map is on absolute greyscale?
""" The probabilities are based on squared differences, so that the absolute grey scale is important.
Probabilities are calculated based on a Gaussian noise model, 
which contains a squared difference term between the reference and the experimental image. 
This has a consequence that the reference needs to be on the same absolute intensity 
grey-scale as the experimental images. RELION and XMIPP reconstruct maps at their absolute
intensity grey-scale. Other packages may perform internal normalisations of the reference 
density, which will result in incorrect grey-scales. Therefore: if the map was reconstructed
in RELION or in XMIPP, set this option to Yes, otherwise set it to No. If set to No, RELION 
will use a (grey-scale invariant) cross-correlation criterion in the first iteration, and 
prior to the second iteration the map will be filtered again using the initial low-pass filter.
This procedure is relatively quick and typically does not negatively affect the outcome of the
subsequent MAP refinement. Therefore, if in doubt it is recommended to set this option to No."""

# {expert} Padding factor:
"""
The padding factor used for oversampling of the Fourier transform. The default is 3x padding, 
which is combined with nearest-neighbour interpolation. However, for large 3D maps, storing the 
entire 3x oversampled Fourier transform (as doubles) plus the real-space padded map in memory may 
be too much. Therefore, for large maps or in cases of many 3D references, in order to fit into memory 
one may need to use a smaller padding factor: e.g. 2, or (not recommended) 1. For padding factors smaller
than 3, (slower) linear interpolation will be used.
 
The approximate amount of memory (in Gb) required to store K maps of (size x size x size) voxels and a 
padding factor (pad) may be calculated as: 
K*2*8*(size*pad)^3/1024/1024/1024 
 
<Note>: also consider the use of threads if memory is an issue.

# Use CTF-amplitude correction?

or Wiener filter. Note that CTF parameters for all images need to
be given in the input STAR file. 
"""

# Has reference been CTF-corrected?
"""
Set this option to Yes if the reference map represents CTF-unaffected density, 
e.g. it was created using Wiener filtering inside RELION or from a PDB. If set to No, 
then in the first iteration, the Fourier transforms of the reference projections 
are not multiplied by the CTFs.

"""

# Have data been phase-flipped?
"""
Set this to Yes if the images have been ctf-phase corrected during the pre-processing steps. 
Note that CTF-phase flipping is NOT a necessary pre-processing step for MAP-refinement in RELION, 
as this can be done inside the internal CTF-correction. However, if the phases do have been flipped, 
one should tell the program about it using this option.
"""
HaveDataPhaseFlipped = False

# Ignore CTFs until first peak?
"""
If set to Yes, then CTF-amplitude correction will only be performed from the first peak 
of each CTF onward. This can be useful if the CTF model is inadequate at the lowest resolution. 
Still, in general using higher amplitude contrast on the CTFs (e.g. 10-20%) often yields better results.
Therefore, this option is not generally recommended.
"""
IgnoreCTFUntilFirstPeak = False

# {expert} Do intensity correction?
"""
An internal correction for differences in the intensity (grey-scale) of the signal between 
distinct micrographs is applied. This is useful if micrographs have very different 
signal-to-noise ratios, e.g. due to different ice thickness or contamination. 
Because one typically normalises the noise, this leads to distinct signal intensities in the data, 
and this procedure corrects for this. It is quite robust and therefore recommended for the general case.

# Particles mask diameter (A):

"""
MaskDiameterA = 200

# Mask references structures?
"""
If set to yes, a mask will also be applied to the reconstructed references. This is useful to set the solvent region of your reconstruction to 0. Either a soft spherical mask (based on the diameter of the experimental image mask given above) or a user-provided mask (next option) may be used. The user-provided mask should have values between 0 and 1 only. Solvent flattening is recommended, but make sure not to mask any signal away.
"""

# {file} Reference mask
"""
A Spider/mrc map containing a (soft) mask with the same dimensions as the reference(s), and values between 0 and 1, with 1 being 100% protein and 0 being 100% solvent. The reconstructed reference map will be multiplied by this mask.If no mask is given, a soft spherical mask based on the diameter of the mask for the experimental images will be applied.  
 
In some cases, for example for non-empty icosahedral viruses, it is also useful to use a second mask. For all white (value 1) pixels in this second mask the corresponding pixels in the reconstructed map are set to the average value of these pixels. Thereby, for example, the higher density inside the virion may be set to a constant. Note that this second mask should have one-values inside the virion and zero-values in the capsid and the solvent areas. To use a second mask, use the additional option --solvent_mask2, which may given in the Additional arguments line (in the Sampling tab).
