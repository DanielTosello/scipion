emx is a pure python module, in order to install it create a directory named emx, copy to it all the files contained in this directory and modify the variable PYTHONPATH so it points towards the new created directory.

In order to modify the variable PYTHONPATH 

For CSH shells, edit .cshrc and add a line like this:
setenv PYTHONPATH ${PYTHONPATH}:/path_to_the_emx_directory

For BASH shells, edit .bashrc and add something like these lines:
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path_to_the_emx_directory

Not sure what shell your terminal is using? Run ‘echo $0′ That’s the number zero.
The changes will take effect in newly opened terminals.

NOTE: At the moment schema validation is made through a subprocess call to the program xmllint or the java library xerces. In the future we will try to use a Python-based library if pure python validator could be found. Therefore xmllint (or xerces) need to be install if schema validation is required. xmlint is usually avaliable through the libxml2 package. The main differences between xerces and xmlint is that the former support xmd 1.1 while xmlint only supports xmd 1.0
