Probabilities are calculated based on a Gaussian noise model,

This has a consequence that the reference needs to be on the same absolute intensity 
grey-scale as the experimental images. RELION and XMIPP reconstruct maps at their absolute
intensity grey-scale. Other packages may perform internal normalisations of the reference 
density, which will result in incorrect grey-scales. Therefore: if the map was reconstructed
in RELION or in XMIPP, set this option to Yes, otherwise set it to No. If set to No, RELION 
will use a (grey-scale invariant) cross-correlation criterion in the first iteration, and 
prior to the second iteration the map will be filtered again using the initial low-pass filter.
