#  - power spectral density (PSD) and CTF estimation on the micrograph
#
# For each micrograph given, this script will perform

# {wizard}(wizardBrowseCTF2) CTF Downsampling factor 
""" 
Set to 1 for no downsampling. Non-integer downsample factors are possible.
This downsampling is only used for estimating the CTF and it does not affect 
any further calculation. Ideally the estimation of the CTF is optimal when 
the Thon rings are not too concentrated at the origin (too small to be seen)
and not occupying the whole power spectrum (since this downsampling might 
entail aliasing).

Give a value in digital frequency (i.e. between 0.0 and 0.5)
This cut-off prevents the typically peak at the center of the PSD 
to interfere with CTF estimation. The default value is 0.05, but for 
micrographs with a very fine sampling this may be lowered towards 0.0

""" 
Give a value in digital frequency (i.e. between 0.0 and 0.5)
This cut-off prevents high-resolution terms where only noise exists 
to interfere with CTF estimation. The default value is 0.35, but it should
 be increased for micrographs with signals extending beyond this value.
However, if your micrographs extend further than 0.35, you should consider
sampling them at a finer rate.
